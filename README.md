I have started porting the firmware to NXP's new 
(https://www.nxp.com/design/development-boards/i.mx-evaluation-and-development-boards/i.mx-rt1010-evaluation-kit:MIMXRT1010-EVK) 
crossover processor, which features an ARM Cortex-M7 core running at 500MHz and 16MB Flash, as well as a 64-bit Floating Point Unit. 

The display will be replaced with a higher resolution 320 x 480 colour display. 

If interested in following along and/or contributing to this project, please send me an email and I will add you to the mailing list:
